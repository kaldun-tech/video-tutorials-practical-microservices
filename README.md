## What I learned
- Microservices help organizations scale as they grow, but they also add complexity. 
- Modular monoliths are preferable for getting new software projects started.
- Event sourcing in distributed systems provides an immutable audit trail of all state changes.
- Idempotent message processing is important for building distributed systems. This prevents duplicate processing of messages.
- CQRS is a pattern that separates read and write models. This allows for optimized access patterns.
- The event store is a specialized database that stores events in a way that allows for temporal queries and replay of events.
- Aggregates are a domain-driven design pattern that represent clusters of related objects treated as a single unit.
- This system has eventual consistency, similar to NoSQL databases like MongoDB. Services may not immediately reflect the latest state of the system.
- Defining clear boundaries between services is critical to defining the scope of each service.

## Fintech-Relevant Patterns

This project demonstrates several architectural patterns that are critical for **financial services applications**:

### üîí Event Sourcing with Message-DB
- **Complete audit trail** - Every state change is stored as an immutable event
- **Temporal queries** - Reconstruct system state at any point in time
- **Regulatory compliance** - Full transaction history for auditing (SOX, PCI-DSS)
- **Example use case:** Financial transaction ledgers, account balance history

### ‚ö° Idempotent Message Processing
- **At-least-once delivery** - Safe message reprocessing without duplicate effects
- **Distributed transaction safety** - Prevents double-charging, duplicate payments
- **Example use case:** Payment processing, fund transfers, settlement operations

### üìä CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- **Separate read/write models** - Optimized for different access patterns
- **Event-driven projections** - Real-time materialized views from event streams
- **Example use case:** Account balance views, transaction history, compliance reports

### üîç Audit Trails & Compliance
- **Immutable event log** - Tamper-proof transaction history
- **Message versioning** - Track schema evolution over time
- **Causation tracking** - Full correlation between related events
- **Example use case:** Fraud detection, dispute resolution, regulatory audits

### üèóÔ∏è Microservices with Domain Events
- **Eventual consistency** - Loosely coupled services communicate via events
- **Autonomous components** - Independent deployment and scaling
- **Example use case:** Payment processing, risk assessment, notification systems

**Why this matters for fintech:** Financial systems require strong guarantees around data consistency, auditability, and reliability. Event sourcing provides an immutable audit log, idempotence prevents duplicate transactions, and CQRS enables real-time reporting without impacting transaction processing.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL run locally in a Docker container
- Knex.js
- Bluebird
- Blue-tape
- Pug
- DigitalOcean App Platform

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.11.0
- PostgreSQL 16
- Knex CLI 2.5.0
- Bluebird 3.5.6
- Blue-tape 1.0.3
- Pug 3.0.2

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   APP_NAME=video-tutorials-practical-microservices
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/video_tutorials
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=3000
   ```

3. Set up the databases:

   **Application Database:**
   - Create a PostgreSQL database named `video_tutorials`
   - Run migrations:
     ```bash
     npx knex migrate:latest
     ```

   **Message Store Database:**
   - Create a PostgreSQL database named `message_store`
   - Install Message DB schema:
     ```bash
     MESSAGE_STORE_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/message_store npm run install-message-store
     ```

   **Note:** The application requires TWO databases:
   - `DATABASE_URL` - Application data (users, videos, pages)
   - `MESSAGE_STORE_CONNECTION_STRING` - Event sourcing messages

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
Start the application with auto-restart on file changes:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Mode
Start the application:
```bash
npm start
```

### Alternative Development Server
Start using the custom development server:
```bash
npm run start-dev-server
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

## Testing

Run the test suite using blue-tape:
```bash
# Currently no test script is configured, run tests directly:
node src/app/home/home.test.js
```

Note: The project uses blue-tape for testing. The main test file is located at `src/app/home/home.test.js`.

## Architecture

This application demonstrates event-sourced microservices using CQRS pattern:

```

### Key Patterns

**Event Sourcing**: All state changes stored as immutable events in Message Store
**CQRS**: Separate write model (Components ‚Üí Events) from read model (Aggregators ‚Üí Projections)
**Eventual Consistency**: Aggregators asynchronously build projections from event streams
**Idempotent Processing**: Safe message reprocessing with at-least-once delivery
