## Architecture Requirements

This application requires:
- **2 PostgreSQL databases**: Application DB and Message Store
- **Node.js runtime**: Express server with microservices components
- **Environment variables**: 7+ required configuration values
- **File storage**: Email pickup directory
- **Auto-scaling**: Handle variable traffic loads

## Cost Comparison (Monthly Estimates)

| Platform | Basic Setup | Production Setup | Scaling Cost |
|----------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| **DigitalOcean** | $17-30 | $50-100 | Linear |
| **AWS EB** | $20-50 | $100-200 | Moderate |
| **AWS ECS** | $25-60 | $150-300 | Optimized |
| **Heroku** | $50-100 | $200-400 | Expensive |

*Costs assume: 1-2 app instances, small DB, basic monitoring*

## Deployment Strategy by Business Objective

### Quick Time-to-Market (2-4 hours)
Deploy to **DigitalOcean App Platform** when:
- Launching an MVP or proof-of-concept
- Budget constraints require predictable costs
- Team lacks deep cloud infrastructure experience
- Focus is on product development, not infrastructure

**Benefits:**
- Fastest deployment path
- All-inclusive pricing (SSL, monitoring, backups included)
- Auto-scaling without configuration complexity
- Built-in CI/CD from GitHub

**ðŸ“„ Follow:** [DigitalOcean Guide](./digitalocean.md)

### AWS Integration Required (4-8 hours)
Deploy to **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** when:
- Existing AWS infrastructure (RDS, S3, etc.)
- Need AWS ecosystem integration
- Transitioning from Heroku seeking cost savings
- Want managed platform with AWS flexibility

**Benefits:**
- Heroku-like simplicity with AWS power
- Easy integration with other AWS services
- Auto-scaling and load balancing included
- Lower cost than Heroku at scale

**ðŸ“„ Follow:** [Elastic Beanstalk Guide](./elastic-beanstalk.md)

### Enterprise Production Requirements (1-3 days)
Deploy to **AWS ECS Fargate** when:
- Need fine-grained infrastructure control
- Compliance requirements (VPC, security policies)
- Multiple microservices requiring orchestration
- Cost optimization critical at scale (Fargate Spot)

**Benefits:**
- Production-grade container orchestration
- Advanced deployment strategies (blue/green, canary)
- Superior cost optimization options
- Best observability and monitoring capabilities

**ðŸ“„ Follow:** [ECS Fargate Guide](./ecs-fargate.md)

## Security Considerations

All deployment guides include:
- **Secrets Management** - Using AWS Secrets Manager, DigitalOcean encrypted env vars
- **Network Security** - VPC configuration, security groups, private subnets
- **SSL/TLS** - Automated certificate provisioning and renewal
- **Database Security** - Encrypted connections, no public access, automated backups
- **IAM Best Practices** - Least-privilege access, role-based permissions

## Prerequisites

Before starting any deployment:

### Required Tools
```bash
# AWS deployments
aws --version        # AWS CLI 2.x
eb --version         # Elastic Beanstalk CLI 3.x (for EB guide)
docker --version     # Docker 20+ (for ECS guide)

# DigitalOcean deployment
doctl version        # DigitalOcean CLI 1.x
```

### Application Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Verify local environment
node --version       # Should be 20.11.0+
psql --version       # Should be PostgreSQL 16+

# Test local build
npm start
```

### Required Accounts
- **AWS**: Account with billing alerts configured
- **DigitalOcean**: Account with payment method (optional)
- **Domain**: Optional but recommended for production

## Environment Variables Reference

All platforms require these environment variables:

```bash
APP_NAME=video-tutorials-practical-microservices
COOKIE_SECRET=generate-random-secret-here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
EMAIL_DIRECTORY=/path/to/email/directory
SYSTEM_SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS=noreply@yourdomain.com
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
MESSAGE_STORE_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/message_store
```

See individual guides for platform-specific configuration methods.

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Database connection errors**: Check security groups and connection strings
- **Environment variables not loading**: Verify platform-specific configuration
- **Port conflicts**: Most platforms expect PORT from environment
- **Migration failures**: Ensure database is accessible before deploying

### Getting Help
- Review individual deployment guide troubleshooting sections
- Check platform-specific documentation links in each guide
- File issues in this repository for guide improvements

## Cost Optimization Best Practices

Regardless of platform, implement these strategies:

### Development Environments
- Use smaller instance sizes (dev doesn't need production specs)
- Single database instance (not multi-AZ)
- Schedule shutdowns during off-hours (save 40-60%)
- Share resources across dev/staging when possible

### Production Environments
- Enable auto-scaling to match actual demand
- Use reserved instances/savings plans (AWS: 30-50% savings)
- Implement CDN for static assets to reduce bandwidth costs
- Regular cost audits using platform-provided tools

### Database Optimization
- Right-size based on actual query patterns
- Enable connection pooling (reduce connection overhead)
- Regular index optimization and query performance reviews
- Separate read replicas only when needed

## Monitoring & Observability

All platforms provide:
- **Application logs** - Debug issues and track user behavior
- **Performance metrics** - CPU, memory, request rates, response times
- **Health checks** - Automated failure detection and recovery
- **Alerts** - Email/Slack notifications for critical issues

Advanced setups can add:
- Distributed tracing (AWS X-Ray, third-party APM)
- Custom business metrics (conversion rates, feature usage)
- Log aggregation tools (Papertrail, LogDNA, CloudWatch Insights)

## Next Steps

1. **Assess Requirements** - Review your business objectives, team skills, budget
2. **Review** the [Platform Comparison](./comparison.md) for detailed trade-off analysis
3. **Choose Platform** - Based on your specific constraints and goals
4. **Follow Guide** - Each guide includes security, monitoring, and cost optimization
5. **Implement CI/CD** - Automate deployments for faster iteration

## Additional Resources

- **Security**: All guides follow cloud provider security best practices
- **Compliance**: HIPAA/SOC2 considerations noted where applicable
- **Scaling**: Load testing recommendations and scaling strategies included
- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup and restoration procedures documented
